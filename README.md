[Download the Power BI file here (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dXl1Ylq7ZZicfGdEhw5LGGCoap8e_e4r/view?usp=drive_link)

This project presents a detailed state-by-state study of the ENEM (National High School Exam) 2023 scores in Brazil. The analysis explores the relationship between performance in Mathematics, Language and Codes, Writing, Humanities, and Natural Sciences with key sociodemographic variables such as gender, race/color, age group, school type, and monthly household income. The goal is to understand how these factors influence student performance in each state, providing an in-depth view of educational inequalities across the country.

## 🔍 Insights

- Monthly household income is one of the most important factors directly impacting students' performance in the ENEM.  
- Students from public schools perform worse compared to those from private schools, especially in subjects like Mathematics and Natural Sciences.  
- The South and Southeast regions present the highest average scores, while the North region had the lowest overall performance.  
- Educational inequalities vary significantly between states, indicating different regional challenges.  
- Performance is also influenced by sociodemographic factors such as gender and race/color, reflecting historical inequalities.  
- The main challenge is to understand how these inequalities can be reduced and transformed. Future studies and deeper analyses may help find ways to promote educational equity in Brazil.
